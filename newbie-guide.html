Throughout my career I've been across many developers in the beginning their journey in become a programmer.
In general what I observed was common doubts and common mistakes.

In this section I' going to bring all the contents that an beginner should start to learn and also
further references to take it in a next level.

<h1>Git</h1>
<ul>
    {% for post in site.newbies %}
        <li>
            <a href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
                {{ post.title }}
            </a>
        </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
