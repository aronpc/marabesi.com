Have you ever wondered what is test? Testing is between us everyday, when we wake up, when we go to work or even
the act of opening a door. Does that work? how long it will last? Those are common questions that sellers needs
to answer when costumers are buying any product.

And how to find the correct answer? Well, in the product example is simple. The first step is to submit the product
through a series of tests, such as the material resistance, durability, life time and so on. 

> 1. the means by which the presence, quality, or genuineness of anything is determined; a means of trial.
> 2. the trial of the quality of something: to put to the test.
> 3. a particular process or method for trying or assessing.

The essence of a test is simply to guarantee that a given element does what it supposed to do, not more or less 
just what it needs to do.

In software development is the same, software out there need to go through a battery of tests to make sure that
the software works in different environments, different programming language versions or even different browsers 
if we are talking about web software(could be different devices to mobile software).

Often the testing part is done by a QA(Quality Assurance) area, the purpose is guarantee the quality of
the software before submit to the client.
