When deciding that testing is the right decision and it needs to be done, comes the second big
issue, what kind of test do I need to do?

In the software industry we have the piramyd of test, 

This section aims to clarify each type of test and how to apply them. Martin fowler wrote a good article
and explains in his first paragraph:

>Its essential point is that you should have many more low-level unit tests than high level end-to-end tests running through a GUI.

<div class="right-with-margin-bottom">
    <small>
        <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html">martinfowler.com</a>
    </small>
</div>

The pyramid defines that UI tests are expensive in it's execution and unit test are faster.
