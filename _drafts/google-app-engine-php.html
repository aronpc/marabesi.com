<p>App Engine developed by google is a cloud platform to scale applications. There are many programming languages available and we can use it with PHP, unfortunately there isn't much content about it. Here I'm going to show you how to implement a simple API and manage it on Google App Engine.</p>
<p>First thing first, you need to have PHP installed on you machine in order to run the server needed on App Engine, here I'm going to use PHP7 on linux Mint, just be in mind I assume you have at least the PHP 5.5 (this is the version which you find on App engine documentation). Anyway you can go to the PHP documentation to see how properly install PHP on Windows, MAC OS or Linux, just click <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/install.php" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h1>App engine</h1>
<p>The next thing to do is download the SDK to PHP from Google Cloud platform on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads" target="_blank">https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads</a>, here I'm going to assume the linux version that is the one I'm using.</p>

<p>Basically we have everything we need to proceed with it. The next step is execute the local serve to see the google dashboard.</p>
