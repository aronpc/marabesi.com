<h1>Laration - A simple way to visualize your configs</h1>

<p>
    Some times during our development work we need to check wheter a config has been defined, and
    in most of the times we just jump to the file, which means to seek the file, open it and
    change it (or just see the value and leave it as it was).

    Laravel provide us a really simple way to find the configs. This is because Laravel uses
    the dot file pattern, where the configuration needed will be inside of an .env file in the 
    root of the project.    
</p>

{% highlight env %}
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY=base64:IYCeNxLZFcUKLn6IoeCzKFiW0WmVjt6gU36kCBOfr9A=
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_LOG_LEVEL=debug
APP_URL=http://localhost

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=homestead
DB_USERNAME=homestead
DB_PASSWORD=secret
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
    This solution is the basic one and there is nothing wrong with it, let's resume the needed steps
    to get where we want:

    <ul>
        <li>1 - Go to the root of your project</li>
        <li>2 - Find the variable that you want</li>
        <li>3 - Change it or just check it's value</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Laravel also provide us with some defaults, when the Laravel engine don't find the needed
    configuration it will assume a default. The default values are defined inside the <strong>configs/</strong> 
    folder.
