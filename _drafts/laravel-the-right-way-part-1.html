Recently I've been to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/Laravel-SP/events/233563455/" target="_blank">Laravel meetup</a> and I had the pleasure to talk about good pratices and common
 mistakes that newbies in Laravel do in the daily basis. We  had also Guilherme Guitte's 
 talk who had spoken how elastic serach work. 

<h2>Laravel the right way</h2>

<p>There are a few topics that I've been across over and over during my daily basis as a developer using Laravel. 
    This bothers me because some of them are so easy to undestand to use that I decided to divide it in a few 
    topics and try to guide the developers to a better Laravel usage. 
    We will be through composer packages, directory structures and the Laravel docs to compose this topics, 
    so let's dive in.</p>

<h2>Models</h2>

<p>Laravel is a framework with that give to the developer a big responsbility, it gives the ability to you to free chose the location
of your models. Laravel doesn't care if you want to place it in the root directory, divede it into sub directories or
just throw it away on the framework.</p>
