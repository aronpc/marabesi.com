Redable code is a subject of discussions among developers aiming to improve
their code skills and also thinking about the human side of the code, indeed,
the machine executes the code and doesn't care about the redability or
maintainability of the code, instead, this chore, is part of the daily life
of programmers. Redability, can be interpreted in different ways by different
people, therefore, there are initiatives to at least create a common sense.

Previously I reviewed the book "The art of readable code"
{% cite the_art_of_readable_code_review --file 2020-08-23-clean-code-and-the-art-of-redable-code-a-brief-summary %},
this time, the focus is to compare the differences and similarities between
"The art of readable code" and "Clean Code".

## Naming things

The first subject address here is the naming convention that is stated by
both books to be important, as the argument being that we are coding for humans
and not for machines. The study path created by {% cite study_path --file 2020-08-23-clean-code-and-the-art-of-redable-code-a-brief-summary %}
gives a point of attention for naming as well, as it is one of the
sections listed to be read on the Clean code book.
