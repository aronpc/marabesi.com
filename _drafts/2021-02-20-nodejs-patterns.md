Nodejs has been a language that I have been using for a few years now, but never
dedicated my time trying to master it. This post is
about, focusing on the nodejs patterns guided by the book
"NodeJs patterns" by Mario Casciaro and Luciano Mammino.

The sections presented here are a review, on the topics I found most interesting
in the book.

## The nodejs module system


## Callbacks and events
