Microservices are a trend that is growing even more, recently I read the book
"Production-Ready microservices" from Susan J. Fowler and it gave me insights on
how to prepare or at least to have a guide go through when developing
microservices. Besides a few chapters can be taken and applied to any application,
for example the reliability section, which says about process and how to
document them for other developers or other teams.

Here I summarize what I found interesting and what makes sense in my context as
a developer.

## Microservices

The splitting of a
monolithic application into microservices is driven by scalability and
efficiency concerns, but microservices introduce challenges of their own

A successful, scalable microservice ecosystem requires that a stable and
sophisticated infrastructure be in place. In addition, the organizational
structure of a company adopting microservices must be radically changed to
support microservice architecture, and the team structures that spring from
this can lead to siloing and sprawl.

## Stability and Reliability

## Scalability and Performance

## Fault Tolerance and Catastrophe-Preparedness

## Monitoring

## Documentation and Understanding
