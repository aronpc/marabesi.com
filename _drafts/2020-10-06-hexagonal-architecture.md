## Motivation

1. The software canâ€™t be tested with automated test suites because part of the logic needing to be tested is dependent on visual details.
2. it becomes impossible to shift from a human-driven use of the system to a batch-run system.
3. it becomes difficult or impossible to allow the program to be driven by another program when that becomes attractive.

## The solution
