## Simple search and binary search

Simple search is the slowest and one of the first algorithms that we go through
when learning to program, simple search means go over each element of an array
and check if the element that we want has been found. The problem, with this
approach is that it doesn't scale, meaning, it will take N (N = the number
of the elements in the array) to complete.

```
```

The binary search comes into play to make improve the scalability issue
that the simple search has, but as a requirement the array must be sorted,
otherwise it won't work.

```

### Quick sort

### Hash tables
