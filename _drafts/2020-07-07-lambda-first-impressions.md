Lambda has been a hot topic for a while, the proposal is hold in three main
subjects (but not limited to): pay for what you execute only, scalability and composition
(compose with different services such as, AWS s3, Kinesis, IoT etc).
Lambda has changed how users think about cloud computing, giving the end user
the power to chose and to pay for what is indeed executed.

Out of the box, AWS supports different programming languages such as: nodejs,
python, java, ruby, c#, go and powershell {% cite lambda_supported_programming_languages --file 2020-07-07-lambda-first-impressions %}.
