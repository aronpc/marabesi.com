<p>I decided to start a new project to practice and see some action about software engineering. Software Engineering is my subject where I'm current studying and nothing better to exercise what I've learnt and at the same time sharing it.</p>
<p>What I'm proposing here is a bunch of posts focus on developing an application applying software engineering, currently is hard to see applications being developed following some practices.</p>
<h1>What am I going to build ?</h1>
<p>describe here</p>
<h1>When it will start ?</h1>
<p>describe here</p>
<h1>Main goals</h1>
<p>The major goal here is to understand how software engineering works not just on paper but doing it creating scripts, understand concepts, implementing new techniques and so on.</p>
<p>Also I have a personal goal to improve the practice of software engineering, I saw everyday programmers complaining about wrong process while developing an application, I think this could be a good start in how to do it right.</p>
<p>What we will get of all this ? Sharing knowledge of course and learning as well. Developers are always smart in solve problems in algorithms, math and so on but they lack in communication and business need, often those words come together.</p>
