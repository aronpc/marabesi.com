The architecture pattern REST was introduced by Roy Thomas Fielding in 2000
{% cite roy_thomas_fielding_rest --file 2020-05-19-thoughts-on-rest-apis %},
since then, developers address the REST pattern as something related to
the type of requests, such as GET, POST, PUT and PATCH, eventhough the
dissertation presented goes deeper in the architectural style, rather than
implementation details.

This post aims to present resources on how to implement REST as well as
thoughts of APIs distributed by companies.
