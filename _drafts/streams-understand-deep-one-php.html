<p>Usually streams in a common sense are a data that flow through some kind of "pipe" and in
  PHP we can use it in a simple way, here I would like to go through all possibilities but unfortunately it will not be possible given
  the whole world of edge cases that we could have.</p>
<p>The PHP streams are powrful but also they lack a maintenance, it has changed since PHP 7.0 has beend released
but it wasn't the cure, the ogg wrapper for example is not compatible with PHP 5.* anymore.</p>
