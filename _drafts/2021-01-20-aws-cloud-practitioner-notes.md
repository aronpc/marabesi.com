This post aims to expose the path I took to take the AWS cloud practitioner
certification. This post was inspired by {% cite preparing_for_ccp --file 2021-01-04-aws-cloud-practitioner-notes-ec2 %}
and some of the resources I am going to share here were taken from his post as
well my own notes from the free official training {% cite aws_free_training --file 2021-01-04-aws-cloud-practitioner-notes-ec2 %}.

The CCP exam is the first certification in the AWS exam list, as such, if you
have some experience with AWS it should be no problem to complete it. Therefore,
the material needed for this certification depicts the conventions used by aws
and its pricing model.

Before going any further the following list is a collection of each
topic covered by the certification.
