If you are starting with good practices in PHP I would like to recommend the
PHP design patterns it is awesome. The book start with a short introduction in
Object Oriented Programming , UML and the concepts of Design Patterns.

## What are the patterns that I will learn?

The book divides in three sections the patterns, the creational patterns,
structural patterns and Behavioral patterns. Inside of each section is compound
of two patterns and the list bellow explain to us which are they.

- Creational section
  - Factory Method
  - Prototype
- Structural section
  - Adapter
  - Decorator
- Behavioral
  - Template Method
  - State

## In the end ...

As a plus section in the book the author show to us how to use the Proxy
Pattern with MySQL, however, you can use with any database.
