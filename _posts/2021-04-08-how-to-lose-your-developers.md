This post is randoms thoughts around software development from a developer
point of view. The content covered is mainly based on my career, and
the opinions expressed might not fit all scenarios. Do not take
the text as a saint grail or a tutorial, it is more like a conversation on what
I think about developers, soft skills, hard skills and management.

On top of that, I was inspired by the book Mind Map Mastery from Tony Buzan
{% cite buzan2018mind --file 2021-04-08-how-to-lose-your-developers %} and
also by The software craftsman: professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride by
Sandro Mancuso {% cite mancuso2014software --file 2021-04-08-how-to-lose-your-developers %},
which I share the same opinions as he expressed in the book.

The depicted mind map above is the result of my dive into mind mapping, the
subject approach is what this post came to be.

## The well known path

Developers usually start picking up a programming language and playing around
it. The "standard" is to have a computer science (or any related subject) degree
and then start working on for a company.

Usually the shift from study only mode to working mode brings more things
responsibilities. For example, dealing with deadlines, struggling with
bugs, writing documentation, talking with business and trying out new
technologies (just to name a few).

### it is easy

The first way to start a fight in the middle of a meeting with developers is
to say the phrase: "its easy". It is a bonus point if followed by "it's just
a button". This impactful phrase can be taken as two-sided coin, if it comes
from another developer, it will be more likely to be accepted, therefore,
if it comes from a business or someone that is not part of the daily
coding task of developers, it can be interpreted as an "insult".

I see no problem with those phrases, but, in a given context where developers
are working under pressure, having to deal with meetings, support for clients
and many other tasks besides coding, it can be a started for the developer
to lose confidence and start to search for another job.

### Lack of documentation

Since the agile manifesto documentation has been a subject of a second matter.
Even though, being a secondary subject doesn't mean to not have it. Teams
struggle with outdated documentation (when it exists). I personally think
that people misinterpreted the manifesto and uses that as a shield to
jump the documentation step. To achieve technical excellence, documentation
is needed, as it can be used as a way to share knowledge among the team.

### You have until Friday to finish up

Imposing deadlines on developers can lead to friction. Developers are not
a "code machine", writing code takes time, creation and problem-solving.
Sometimes the step to actually write the code is the last of a chain that
starts with the problem to solve.

Building software is not an assembly line, that each stage is well-defined
and workers have to do simple moves to accomplish a task. Building software
is a solving problem and creative process.

Imposing deadlines on developers uncovers illness under the hood of the
team or even the organization. Imagine you going to your dentist and having
the following conversation:

- Dentist: it will take 2 days to finish up your treatment.
- You:  2 days? I can't wait, can you do in 1?

This dialog is weird, as you that have no idea is trying to impose how long
the dentist's work is going to take. Did you find this weird? This is the feeling
that developers have when managers or business start to pressure for
sooner deliveries.

### Don't worry we will test it later

Developers deliver value through tasks, be it in a staging environment or in
production, the final word should be from the users, or the ones that are
responsible for the feature. It also applies for bug fixes, the one who
wrote the bug ticket, should be the one to double-check it and
give a positive feedback.

There is a long journey to fix something or implement something. It requires
communication both with the business and also code wise, then understanding
the code that is in place, modifying it and often, add something on top of
it.

It gets worse when the code base is not focused on technical excellence, thus,
making the previous steps even harder.

Let's say that all the steps have been finished up and the bug or feature
has been deployed to staging, on the developer side, it is a lot of
expectation because it is the time when the user will see
the change and confirm that. This loop should be as short as possible, and
not testing it right after it was delivered leads to:

- Frustration
- Lack of confidence with the team

Longer feedback circles can also lead to the feature or bug to be reworked
and change too may time, as the cycle is long, often it is difficult to
keep track of all the changes and make decisions.

## Tackling the engineering culture

Pack Kua, in his talk {% cite pat_kua_engineering_culture --file 2021-04-08-how-to-lose-your-developers %}
enumerates a few ideas that I would like to share here
as they are engineering oriented. Those ideas are based on his experience working
across different projects and companies.

The part I enjoyed the most is the distinction between the enterprise scenario
and the startup, on his talk those are totally different things and he uses
that to contrast those two worlds.
