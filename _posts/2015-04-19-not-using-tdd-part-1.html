<p>I've been working with TDD for while and everyday I see developers creating excuses to do not start with TDD, and I ask myself why they do that? Is there any reason for ? Maybe the procrastination and the fear of new challenges comes to mind.</p>
<p>TDD has basically a life-cycle to be follow and and here I'll try to show how to getting started with.</p>
<p>Here is a couple of slides of my presentation "Introduction to TDD (PHPunit exaamples)". It may help you to understand the TDD world combined with this post content, so I hope you enjoy the post and please if you have any questions, feedback let me know.</p>

<h1>RED</h1>
<p>The first step is the RED and the most common I guess, the color red in TDD represents the failure. I have had a lot of bug found in my code before I adopt TDD because I used to think that piece of code works but, I forgot to test what I've done with different inputs, different scenarios and so on. The red stage as we go through will show us many scenarios and many cases where our code will have a little bug.</p>
<p>Is in red stage as well where we do not write our source code first and indeed we will write or test first. The benefits of doing this is awesome and we can enumerate a couple of them :</p>
<p>1) Improvement of our source code design</p>
<p>2) prevent the high complexity</p>
<p>3) Getting confidence with our source code</p>
<h1>GREEN</h1>
<p>The green color is a perfect clue to the red after we created our test and see its failing now its time to pass it and make it green !</p>
<p>The rule here is do not make a complex algorithm instead we will make it pass as easy as possible and by that I mean with hard code. It seems weird at first but everything will make sense in the blue stage of TDD where we will do some code refactoring.</p>
<p>The goal of GREEN stage is to make the test pass and do not the best way of solve your problem or to create a amazing snippet instead we are trying to achieve the simplest solution to see our desired green (our test passing).</p>
<h1>BLUE</h1>
<p>Finally we have got our BLUE stage known as refactor stage as well. Now we already have a test passing and we know what we have to have to solve our problem right ? Let's recap what we've done so far:</p>
<p>1) We created a test and saw it fail</p>
<p>2) We fixed the code to make it pass with hard code</p>
<p>Nowadays programming hard code is not a good practice and worse it will not solve your problem correctly so now is the perfect time to refactor the hard code and think in the best way of solving your problem, but of course without breaking your test.</p>
<p>The test passing is our safeness to refactor and improve our source code without side-effects. And here we reach in a great benefit of TDD, <strong>refactoring without fear</strong>. Before TDD I used to change some legacy code to fix a bug or to improve the code but in a few weeks forward after my change in the code I had a new bug to fix caused by my own change.</p>
<h1>WRAPPING UP !</h1>
<p>This is the first post of a series about TDD. I presented to you the life cycle of TDD and how to understand each stage of it (red, green and blue). To get deep into the TDD work I'd recommend the book <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-01-26-tdd-by-example %}">TDD by example by Kent Beck</a> (examples in Python and Java), a quick read in <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/series/the-solid-principles--cms-634" target="_blank">SOLID principles</a> and finally try to find some material of TDD in a programming language you are familiar and do not give up !</p>
