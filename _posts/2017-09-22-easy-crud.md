Latelly I had the opportunity to implement a basic CMS in the project that I was
working on, unfortunatelly I had the change but not the time needed to achieve that.

What I was looking for:

1. The package must operate Create, Read, Update and Delete operations
2. The package must have a dashboard 
3. The package must use Laravel models 

Besides that the perfect project would be the one that I could use all the models and
the existing database tables of my project.

Given the scenario I started to search packages that could have something like that, and
I found a few interesting ones:

- [CRUD Generator](https://github.com/appzcoder/crud-generator)
- [CRUD Booster](https://github.com/crocodic-studio/crudbooster)

Both are the most famous CRUD packages in the Laravel world. They are amazing and
have many features ready to use. But as it looks really good, for me it was too much and
both needs to handle with database migrations - probably it is something
to store user preferences or something like that.

As I was testing those packages I notice that the steup was not so hard, actually 
it was simpler than I thought but I wasn't able to use the database tables 
that I already had in my Laravel project.

## Easy CRUD

Well, as I couldn't find a project that fits my need I decided to start
Easy CRUD. Easy CRUD is a project that generates a dashboard and CRUD operations
to Laravel models.

The cool thing is that you don't need anything extra such as migrations, Easy
CRUD uses the existing Laravel project estructure.

The focus of the project is to make easy handling existing data in your projects.
Nothing specific with business logic but rather, easily create, update and even 
delete existing data.

Key Easy CRUD features:

1. Manage data without changing database structure
2. Use Laravel Models to perform CRUD operations
3. Middlewares are allowed to control access to Easy CRUD routes
