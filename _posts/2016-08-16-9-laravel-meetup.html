<p>Recently I've been to Laravel meetup in São Paulo hold by iMasters coordened by Ravan and Zizaco,
both working for Leroy Merlin and using Laravel (of course).

The meetup started with a really good introduction and interation between the audience, thanks iMasters for the coffee-break.
Usually the people who go to the meetup are known by the hosts. They were really confortable with each other which I think is really good.

The main goal of the meetup was to help newbies in Laravel(specifically in middlewares ). The first speaker(Igor Carvalho) started
his talk.

<h2>Middleware 4 Life</h2>

<p>

His talk was a really good introduction to middlewares concept in how we can benefit from them and how to implement them
using Laravel, Silex and Symfony. The onion concept was shown to the audience and code snippets were executed, this
combination was a really good move because we could understand the concept in practice.

The meetup had also Marcel as a second speaker who presented an amazing talk in how we as a developers can keep up to date
with so many technologies and so many paths to take.

<h2>Mantenha-se Atualizado - A eterna jornada de aprendizado de um desenvolvedor de software</h2>

Keep up to date - A developer's eternal joruney of leanership ("Mantenha-se Atualizado - A eterna jornada de aprendizado de um desenvolvedor de software - Marcel dos Santos" - Original title in Portuguese)

<p>

</p>

<p>Marcel is a well known developer in various communities in São Paulo and he has spoken in many conferences
such as PHP Experience (one of the biggest PHP conference in Brasil). His talk was the inspiring one,
he talked about the difficulty of being an I.T professional.</p>

<p>His talk wasn't the tech one and came to balance the meetup, indeed we aren't machines we need to communicate.
We need to interact more with each other and also be open minded with other programming languages and new technology.

The book "The pragmatic programmer" was mentioned and inspired Marcel to create his talk. The main message that we could
get from it was "think <strong>outside the box</strong>".</p>

<h2>Time to go</h2>

<p>The meetup ended with a great interaction among all members, we formed a good debate based in the talks presented.
It is always good to know you are not alone in some issues, there we shared many problems, solutions and
possiblities.

The main lessons I could take from there was that programmers are not segregated, those kind of activities should be
    taken by everyone from any professional field. It is a way to learn, share and teach.
