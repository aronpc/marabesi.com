<p>The Hexadecimal system work in base 16 which  means that we have 15 (fifteen) numbers as shown bellow.</p>

<h1>PHP and Hex</h1>
<p>In the table above we have 16 numbers and its corresponding values, the highest is 15 and the lowest is 0. Knowing this rule what will the code bellow will output ?</p>

{% highlight php %}
<?php
echo 0xFF;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The right answer is <strong>255</strong> !</p>
<p>When I first saw this expression I thought, it will output 1515. No doubts! If in the content table above the F represents 15 it is easy, with two F it will concatenate.</p>
<p>But be careful with that ! It is wrong thinking, the conversion is made as the same way as octal conversion (<a href="http://marabesi.com/php/php-basics-sure-tell-use-octal-system/">you can see the octal post conversion here</a>).</p>
<p>First of all we need to convert the letters F into numbers which are 15, if it was the letter A would be 10 and so on, just look to the hexadecimal table. (tip: I like to think that from A to F its just 10 to 15)</p>
<p>Now that we have the value of F we can use this in the equation :</p>
<p>15×16¹ + 15×16° = 255<sub>10</sub></p>
<p>15×16¹ = 240</p>
<p>15×16° = 15</p>
<p>240 + 15 =<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> 255 !</span></strong></p>
<p>Remember the sample that we use is  { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F }</p>
