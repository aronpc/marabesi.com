<p>If you are not familiar with raspberry PI please go ahead and see <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org" target="_blank">this</a> web site, I'm not going to be talking about what is and what it can do rather I want to go further and focus on just the raspberry PI + camera.</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2015-01-31-raspberry-pi-meeting-rpi-cam-web-interface/cover.png" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-382 size-full aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2015-01-31-raspberry-pi-meeting-rpi-cam-web-interface/cover.png" alt="" width="770" height="578" /></a></p>

<p>RPi-Cam-Web-Interface is a simple interface that enable the users to interact with the camera module on the raspberry PI, it has a lot of documentation and the <a href="https://github.com/silvanmelchior/RPi_Cam_Web_Interface" target="_blank">code</a> is really easy to understand if you're a programmer.</p>
<p>The interface is very easy to use and it has a lot of features such as resolution adjust, control of brightness, saturation and contrast.</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2015-01-31-raspberry-pi-meeting-rpi-cam-web-interface/rpi-web-interface2.png" target="_blank"><img class=" wp-image-385 size-full aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2015-01-31-raspberry-pi-meeting-rpi-cam-web-interface/rpi-web-interface2.png" alt="" width="1198" height="971" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the main feature of the the RPi-Cam-Web-Interface is be web based. Easy to use easy to share across multiple devices and easy to modify as well.</p>
<h1>Behind the scenes, how does it works ?</h1>
<p>The web interface was wrote in PHP and it has a interaction with the linux in the raspberry in resume what the web interface does is, time by time the script takes a picture and save it in a directory (you can easily change the default folder where it is saved) and then refresh the the page with the new picture through the javascript.</p>
<h1>Would you like to try ?</h1>
<p>You can find the official tutorial in the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=63276" target="_blank">raspberry website</a> and loads more on google</p>
