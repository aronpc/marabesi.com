2020 was a mixed year for reading, in my list I had technical subjects, productivity, algorithms, software architecture, programming methodologies, microservices and leadership. In total I read 1k pages across the listed subjects.

![Books read in 2020](/images/posts/2021-02-11-2020-a-year-of-reading/featured.jpg)

This section provides my thouthgs on each of them, my personal opinions and the book I enjoied the most {% cite good_reads_2020 --file 2021-02-11-2020-a-year-of-reading %}.

Disclaimer: The order I list the books here does not representthe order I
read them, instead I combined them into sections that relates closer subjects.

## Software architecture patterns

Software architecture patterns was one of the books I will keep for reference
as it provides 5 chapters with different architectures, diagrams and examples
of applications that use such pattern. I wrote a post about the patterns
used in the book while I was reading it {% cite post_software_architecture_patterns --file 2021-02-11-2020-a-year-of-reading %},
the books is around 47 pages long and catalogs the following architectural
styles:

- Layered
- Event-driven
- Microkernel
- Microservices
- Spaced-based

{% cite software_architectural_patterns --file 2021-02-11-2020-a-year-of-reading %} goes through each style and gives
a few examples on how to use them, the diagrams used are helpful to
depict the architecture components. Pat Kua {% cite kua2017evolutionary --file 2021-02-11-2020-a-year-of-reading %} uses the listed
architecture styles in his talk as a context to build
evolutionary architecture.

## Production ready microservices

This was one of the first books I read focused on microservices, as such it
is a complete guide on what, when and how to handle microservices. Susan Fowler
catalogs the aspects that matters while choosing the microservices architecture
for the enterprise {% cite fowler2016production --file2021-02-11-2020-a-year-of-reading %}.

## Grokking algorithms

Grokking algorithms {% cite bhargava2016grokking --file 2021-02-11-2020-a-year-of-reading %} was a book for remembering classical algorithms and
implementation that as a programmers we use everyday without noticing it.
Aditya depicts the algorthms in a visual fashion, transforming the book
a choice for first year Computer Science students(and of course, experienced developers that might want a refresher on the subject).

## Extreme programming explained

Extreme programming by Kent Beck and Cynthia Andres {% cite extreme_programming_kent_beck --file 2021-02-11-2020-a-year-of-reading %} was on of the most
pleaseant readings of the year. The history of agile is written in this
book, the new approach to develop software in pairs and focusing on code
was a "crazy" idea at that time.

Unfortunately the XP is followed not as much as SCRUM, which in my opinion is the XP, but focused on process for managers, not programmers.

## Redis for dummies

Redis for dummies was a easy read to recap a few redis concepts and
ideas on how to use it.

## Get your hands dirty on clean architecture

Software architecture has been a subject of interest for me
for long time. I started to practice TDD then followed with
software architecture. The clean architecture is one of the most
popular style among developers.

Uncle bob defined the clean architecture based on different styles,
fetching what each one of the others has to offer best and then
added his own thoughts {% cite clean_architecture_article --file 2021-02-11-2020-a-year-of-reading %}. The result is the clean architecture, which
is a history across the computer history, best practices on programming
and also a architectural style definition, named clean.

Therefore, Uncle bob's architecture {% cite clean_architecture_book --file 2021-02-11-2020-a-year-of-reading %} does not provide an implementation
for his architecture, it is a theorical book.

Tom, on the other hand, took the clean architecture and gave his
opinionated implementation {% cite hombergs2019get --file 2021-02-11-2020-a-year-of-reading %}, using the java programming language.
Get your hands on clean architecture is a reading for programmers
that want to understand the clean architecture in a praticalway.

## Talking with tech leads

Pat Kua {% cite kua2014talking --file 2021-02-11-2020-a-year-of-reading %} assembled a collection of advices from tech leads from various
sectors in the industry, the insights provided is a handful list
of do's and dont's for novices in the tech lead role and for
experienced ones.

## 14 habits of highly productive developers

Zeno Rocha {% cite rocha2020habits --file 2021-02-11-2020-a-year-of-reading %} collected 14 habits that
might help developers to achieve their career goasl. It is
not a recipe to follow as it is described, rather it is a
friendly companion to keep under the shelf and consult it
from time to time.

## Introduction to mathematical thinking

This book is a companion from the MOOC(Massive Open Online Courses)
by Dr. Keith Devlin named
"Introduction to Mathematical Thinking". The MOOC is aimed at
students that are coming from school mathematics and want to
level up to university mathematics, or at least to get started
with it.

The course is one of the best I have ever taken and as such, the
companion book has exercices to follow on the course.
