Some times during our development work we need to check wheter a config has been defined, and
in most of the times we just jump to the file, which means to seek the file, open it and
change it (or just see the value and leave it as it was).

Laravel provide us a really simple way to find the configs. This is because Laravel uses
the dot file pattern, where the configuration needed will be inside of an .env file in the 
root of the project.

```bash
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY=base64:IYCeNxLZFcUKLn6IoeCzKFiW0WmVjt6gU36kCBOfr9A=
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_LOG_LEVEL=debug
APP_URL=http://localhost

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=homestead
DB_USERNAME=homestead
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

This solution is the basic one and there is nothing wrong with it, let's resume the needed steps
to get where we want:

1. Go to the root of your project.
2. Find the variable that you want.
3. Change it or just check it's value.

Laravel also provide us with some defaults, when the Laravel engine don't find the needed
configuration it will assume a default. The default values are defined inside the **configs/**
folder.

The first problem comes when we try to find each default value, to achieve that we will need to first go to the
.env file, and only if the value doesn't exists we will try to find it on the config folder.
This approach is the most common but as we probably noticed, we spend much time just to try to find what we need.

The approach above also revels a new kind of problem, what if we would like to see all the environment variables at once ?
Unfortunatelly this is not possible without programming something inside Laravel, by creating a controller and exposing
all the configs throughout the helper **config()**;

1. Go to the root of your project.
2. Find the variable that you want.
3. Go to the configs folder and find the default value.
4. Change the default value or just check it.

The step number 3 will require more time if you don't know in which file the variable that you want is. This behavior
is a consequence of Laravel's structure, for each section of configuration you will have different files.

![Laravel config files](/images/posts/2016-11-26-laration/configs.png "Laravel config files")

To solve the probles listed above, Laration was born a simple Laravel package to list your configurations being used by your application.

## Laration

Laration is a small package (actually has only one class) and can manage your environment variables really easy. The 
package can be found on [github](https://github.com/marabesi/laration){:target="_blank"} and easily installed using composer.

Laration provides an interface in your command line to list the variables being used by your application
divided into sections, by this you can simply see the variables from your cache, session, services and many others
in your terminal, right way, without looking for further files.

From now on I'll assume that you have composer installed in your machine,
if don't please follow [this](https://getcomposer.org/download){:target="_blank"}
link and make sure you have composer globally installed.

## Creating simple Laravel application

First of all you need to have a Laravel application, if you have already skip to the next part of this post, othersie
keep reading and set up your first Laravel application.

Before move on, let's install the Laravel installar on composer with the following command:

```bash
composer global require "laravel/installer"
```

Two bullets to pay attention, you do need to have composer already installed in your machine and to proceed
this command should being executed with success. If any error occurrs please step back and fix it.

The next step here is to install the Laravel application, this is a matter to execute a second command
in your terminal. The following command will create a new Laravel application inside a folder called 
**laration_demo**.

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel laration_demo && cd laration_demo
```

The image below shows us that an application has been created successfully and is ready to use. Make sure to see the same
result in your terminal, if not, something went wrong. In this case try to start from the begining.

![Laravel successfully installed](/images/posts/2016-11-26-laration/installed-successfully.png "Laravel successfully installed")

Now let's serve our newest application using Laravel's built-in server. To complete this task we are going to use 
Artisan.

```bash
php artisan serve
```

The command above will start a local web server and it will be available to access through the port 8000, to access it
go in your prefered browser and type **[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000){:target="_blank"}**

The message **Laravel development server started on http://localhost:8000** should be displayed, and you 
will have the same as in the figure below:

![Laravel welcome page](/images/posts/2016-11-26-laration/welcome-laravel.png "Laravel welcome page")

Finally we've got a Laravel application running, the next step will show how
to install the **Laration** package and how to configure it.

## Installing Laration

The Laration package will work only in a Laravel based application, to install it we need to change
code inside the Laravel application and the first step is to add the dependency in the **composer.json**.
Open the file composer.json and add the following dependency to it :


```json
{
    "marabesi/laration": "dev-master"
}
```

In the end you'll have something similar to the following image:

![Adding laration as a dependency](/images/posts/2016-11-26-laration/composer.png "Adding laration as a dependency")

We are almost done, the last step is to update the dependencies. To do this go back to your terminal inside the **laration_demo**
folder and execute the following:

```bash
composer update
```

The command will update all the dependencies inside your Laravel application, but as we just added one new dependency
and no one has been changed you will see that composer just added the Laration package, as shown in the image below:

![Composer command output](/images/posts/2016-11-26-laration/laration.png "Composer command output")

Finally we have both, the Laravel application and the Laration package. The last step to see Laration in action
is to add the command inside the Laravel. To achieve this we are going to add a single line of code
inside the file located in **app/Console/Kernel.php**

![Laravel kernel file (app/Console/Kernel.php)](/images/posts/2016-11-26-laration/kernel.png "Laravel kernel file (app/Console/Kernel.php)")

The Kernel.php file has an attribute called **$commands**, this attribute is where we must register all the commands
available to be used in the application, there we are going to add the Laration command. By default it comes with and simple one line comment, as demonstrated 
in the code bellow:

```php
<?php
/**
 * The Artisan commands provided by your application.
 *
 * @var array
 */
 protected $commands = [
     //
 ];
```

The change will be to remove the one comment line and add the code **\Marabesi\Laration::class**. The final
code should be the same as the below:

```php
<?php
/**
 * The Artisan commands provided by your application.
 *
 * @var array
 */
 protected $commands = [
     \Marabesi\Laration::class
 ];
```

Of course that you may have other commands available to you application, it really depends what you have already built.
In this case just append the Laration command to the end of the **$command** attribute.
Now you've successfully installed the Laravel framework within an applicatino and the Laration package.

The last test will be on the command line. let's invoke our friend Artisan and see if the Laration has been installed.

```bash
php artisan | grep laration
```

The command should return something like the image below. 

![Verifying Laration installation](/images/posts/2016-11-26-laration/laration-artisan.png "Verifying Laration installation") 

The frase "List all environment variables used" confirm that the Laration
has been installed. In the same result you will be allow to see all the commands
available to use within Laration.


## Playing around with Laration

The Laration package comes with a series of commands to list the environment
variables. To get start with, we are going to see all the application variables.
In order to do that we can easly invoke Laration to do this job for us.

```bash
php artisan laration:list app
```

All the variables used by the application will be shown, in this case the values should be different in the picture
and yours, because the application that you have may be different. It will be the same result if you like me have installed
a fresh copy of Laravel.

![Laration successfull command output](/images/posts/2016-11-26-laration/laration-app.png)

In the left side the keys are displayed and in the right side it's value. If the key is an array it will keep repeating itself
till the last element be reached, in the picture we can see the key **providers** as an example of it.

For each section of configuration Laration give us a different command,
but the pattern still the same. The project on github is well documented,
but just for simplicity I'm going to post here all the commands and its
description.

|Configuration section|Laration command|
|--- |--- |
|app|php artisan laration:list app|
|broadcasting|php artisan laration:list broadcasting|
|cache|php artisan laration:list cache|
|database|php artisan laration:list database|
|filesystem|php artisan laration:list filesystem|
|mail|php artisan laration:list mail|
|queue|php artisan laration:list queue|
|session|php artisan laration:list session|
|view|php artisan laration:list view|

As you can see the pattern still the same, but the section changes, what turns
Laration easy to use and to remember it's commands. There is a deeper content
when it comes to custom enrivoments variables but it will be covered in other
post in the future.

Laration came to help us in the daily bases when we are trying only to get a
given value in the application environment. Laration allow us to spend the time
in what is important and not trying to find where the variable needed is.

There is no way to change a given variable value by the time of this post,
but of course it can change along the way.
