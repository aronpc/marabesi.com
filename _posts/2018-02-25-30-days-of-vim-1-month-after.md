After one month using vim, I am clearly addicted to it. It has eveything I need and I can always find
a plugin to make it even better. Though, it is true that depending on the plugin it makes vim to slow.

To give an example, I tried to use the auto-save plugin, but it turns out to turn my vim slow when saving.
That's because everytime I touched one keystroke it was saving the file. I just decided to go without the
plugin and it is fine.

## Productivity

I feel that my fingers are faster while typing, and when possible I try to avoid repetition. Normally
what I would do is just type 4x to erase a code spaced with 4 spaces, now I type `4` and the `x`, which
produces the same output.
