ReactJS is among one of the most used javascript library according to GitHub it is
one of the mos popular started repository. Given its popularity it is expected
that the communicty around it will start to develop techniques, guides and tutorials
around patterns.

Inspired by the software systematic review literature paper
{% cite tamburri2020success --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}, that collects a broader
overview of the software engineering success and failure factors, this post has
the goal to answer the following questions:

- **Q1.** What is the most popular ReactJS pattern?
- **Q2.** What are the themes that appears related to the patterns?

Opposed to the scientific method presented by the authors (the research was
conducted mining scientific bases, named: IEEE explorer, ACM digital library,
science direct, springer link, scopus and engineering village), this post is
a collection based on google search.

Besides the questions to be answered in this post, the aim is also to be a source to access when in doubt of which reactjs pattern to learn first and also a guide to help beginners to have a picture of the patterns that developers most talk about. 

## Finding reactjs patterns articles

Google blocks the crawling on search, in this case the approach taken was
the google custom search (https://stackoverflow.com/a/30041104/2258921). The custom
search (https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/using_rest) API allow
developers to use google search programatically, and works as google search,
the difference is that this integration allow calls progammatically.

The first interaction with the API showed a particular behavior that this service
has, as pointed by {% cite google_employee_search_results --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %},
the total number in the result is not the real number, it is an approximation.

The search string used for explore the first researching question, was "reactjs patterns".
Searching for this string in google.com, in the first page is shown 904 results.
Executing the same query through the programmable search gives 161 results,
and mining the results through the API, gives 96 results. This behavior
is expected as pointed by {% cite google_employee_search_results --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}.

To mine the results a javascript file was developed, the script executes recursively
based on the number of pages that google returns till the last page of results
for a given search string. In total 96 links were found and saved to a XLS file {% cite google_search_results --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
for further analysis described in the next section.

## Mining results

A manual analysis of the results was made in the following steps:

1. Removed results that does not have reactjs patterns discussions, such as explaining a
pattern or listing a pattern.
2. Classify each search result into a category.

For 1, a manual approach was taken to go through each item in the search result
to apply the exclusion criteria. As result 14 items were removed {% cite google_search_results --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %} (the removed
content can be found in the tab "mined").

For 2, the following categories were created to group the search results: book,
course, meetup, post, question, slides, video. The categories were generated
based on a manual review of each item.

|Category |Total|
|---------|-----|
|post     |66   |
|course   |7    |
|book     |3    |
|question |2    |
|video    |2    |
|meetup   |1    |
|slides   |1    |

The category `post` is the most popular, followed by `course` and `book`, `question` and
`video` have the same number of items (2) and in the last two spots are `meetup` and `slides`.

## Analyzing the results

This section dives into the results found, presents a brief explanation of each
item in the list. Therefore, this section does not cover the categories `question`,
`meetup`, `video` and `slides` as they present less than three items.

### Posts

The post category is the most popular with 66, as a first exploration the posts
were read, and for each of them a pattern name was manually assigned, based on the content
of the post. Most of them have more the one pattern associated with it, for
example, the first post, in the list covered 22 patterns.

This process was repeated for each post in the list. Once the classification was done,
the word cloud {% cite word_cloud --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
visualization was generated (the process is described in the next sentence).

[![Word cloud generated based on the classification](/images/posts/2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search/word_cloud.png "Word cloud generated based on the classification, click to see the visualization")](/artifacts/posts/2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search/word-cloud){:target="_blank"}

The raw classification was processed using the following steps:

1. Similar words were normalized, the word "component" and "components" were normalized
to the word without s (singular form), resulting in "component"
2. Words with capital letter were normalized to use the lower case.
3. Different words used with common mean were normalized, for example, the higher order component
is commonly used as HoC, the shorter version was used.

The word cloud depicts the translation between the most cited patterns used in the dataset. The most cited pattern is Component, followed by props taking into consideration just a single word.


## Discussion

This section dive deeper in the results depicted in the previous section, the first sub section focus on **Q1** and the second section focuses on **Q2**.

### Q1

For **Q1**, based on the pure pattern classification the results point to the most popular pattern being the "component",
followed by "props" which are the foundation of ReactJs, as everything is a component, and communication happens via props. A first hypothesis into this result is the repetition of those two patterns to explain more complex ones, for developers that are starting into the reactjs, components and props are the first principles to understand.

[![lollipop graph](/images/posts/2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search/lollipop.png "lollipop graph, top 10, click to see the visualization")](/artifacts/posts/2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search/lollipop){:target="_blank"}

In addition to that complex patterns such as hooks and higher order components appear surrounding the component and prop pattern. Those are the patterns which requires from the developer a previous understanding of props and components as they are more complex, which in turn, can lead to less content related to those patterns.

### Q2

For **Q2** the surrounding elements are the focus, so for example, terms like
best practices and design were found and are related to reactjs patterns.

<!-- Code reuse, separate of concerns, readability, easy to maintain,-->
As such, {% cite post_clean_code_dirty_code --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %},
entitled "Clean Code vs. Dirty Code: React Best Practices", enumarates 14 sections
about best practices. Those sections are related to code standards, javascript
features, naming variables and also about industry standard to follo when coding
like DRY.

## Related work

This section dives in the content of each post mined and group them in the
different patterns found. It is possible for the same post to appear in different
sections, as the content might explore more than one at time.

### Container component

{% cite post_react_patterns --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
uses the Jason Bonta's definition of the container component: the container component fetches data, and then
renders it's corresponding sub component. That's it. {% cite post_react_component_patterns --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %} and {% cite  post_simple_react_design_patterns_container_view --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %} agrees on
the same definition as {% cite post_react_patterns --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
and adds that, the container component is the place to connect to redux.

The following code from {% cite post_react_patterns --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %} depicts
the container component using class component. {% cite post_simple_react_patterns --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
also offers a code example.

```jsx
const CommentList = ({ comments }) => (
  <ul>
    {comments.map(comment => (
      <li>
        {comment.body}-{comment.author}
      </li>
    ))}
  </ul>
);

class CommentListContainer extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super()
    this.state = { comments: [] }
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    $.ajax({
      url: "/my-comments.json",
      dataType: 'json',
      success: comments =>
        this.setState({comments: comments});
    })
  }

  render() {
    return <CommentList comments={this.state.comments} />
  }
}
```

{% cite post_implementing_the_container_pattern_using_react_hooks --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
elaborates on the container component with hooks along side with a todo list app that implements the pattern. Also the definition
followed was the same as {% cite post_react_patterns --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}, it
seems that there is a consensus that Jason Bonta defined the container component pattern
and developers point to him. {% cite post_introduction_to_react_design_patterns --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
rates the cotainer component as a pattern that provides: separation of concerns, it
is reusable and it is testable.

{% cite post_the_react_redux_container_pattern --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %} expands on
the idea that container component is awere of redux, the same
argument made by {% cite post_react_patterns --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}, but in
this case, the author gives "the internet" the credit to agree on that. {% cite post_2019_reactjs_best_practices --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %} has somehow
a not so clean definition about container component, also the text mix HoC with
presentational components and other patterns.

### Conditional rendering

{% cite post_evolving_patterns_in_react --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
gives his opinions on the conditional rendering pattern and also states that
it is a narutal step for developers to separate logic from the actual return code (the code
given as example is a ternary if). As an alternative to the conditional
rendering, the author suggests to use the JSX alternative with `&&`. {% cite post_react_conditional_rendering --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
expands on the JSX alternatives for conditional rendering.

### Compound Components

{% cite post_advanced_react_component_patterns --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %} and
{% cite post_five_ways_to_advanced_react_patterns --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
share the same definition, the compound components are components that are distinct, but does not work without
the other, they make sense together only. Furthermore, {% cite post_advanced_react_component_patterns --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %} mentions the HTML
`select` and `option` as an example of compound components. {% cite post_seven_patterns_by_example --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %} uses
the compount component pattern to build a radio group component, which the user can select only one option
between the avaialbe options.

### Decorated component

The decorated component is a pattern that does not not appear often,
{% cite post_patterns_for_testable_react_components --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
demonstrates the decorated component as a way to decouple components, or even
to enhance component features, Redux uses the decorated component pattern
to enhance the component props.

Therefore, the decorated pattern can be used as a way to decouple the component
that fetch data with the one that actually uses the data. {% cite post_2019_reactjs_best_practices --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %} states that
the decorated pattern is the same as HoC.

### Higher-Order-Component

{% cite post_evolving_patterns_in_react --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %} and
{% cite post_2019_reactjs_best_practices --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
agree on the definition that HoC, in a sense that HoC are decorators. {% cite post_advanced_react_component_patterns --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %} though, has an
argument that the HoC name is misnormer, which is based on his own thoughts.

A HoC takes a reactjs component enhances it and then returns the new enhanced
component to be used {% cite post_five_ways_to_advanced_react_patterns --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
{% cite post_simple_react_patterns --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
{% cite post_advanced_patterns_reactjs --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
{% cite post_reactjs_in_patterns --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %} 
{% cite post_higher_order_components --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
{% cite post_react_component_types_a_complete_overview --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}.

{% cite post_react_patterns_react_and_ramda --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %} has a different
definition, which states that the HoC receives a component as an argument and returns
another component. This definition is weider than the previous one. Often the
HoC receives a component and enhance the same component functionality, and returns
the same camponent with added behavior, from {% cite post_react_patterns_react_and_ramda --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
would be possible to receive A and then return B.

Therefore, {% cite post_patterns_for_data_fetching_in_react --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
states that HoC is responsbile to fetch data and then propagate to child components. This definition is an addition
to the previous agreed definition, but does not restrict the pattern to be used as data fetch only. {% cite post_5_react_data_fetching --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %} adds that
the HoC is used to fetch data and also split data fetching from data presentation.
For the first time, the HoC is compared as a `container pattern` and not the 
`decorated component pattern`.

{% cite post_how_advanced_react_patterns_changed_with_hooks --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
explores the HoC in the new era of react hooks.

{% cite post_patterns_style_composition --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %} has no
definition statement, though the content is followed with HoC code examples.

### Render Props / Render callback

The render props or render callback pattern is used to render a given component
based on a function callback {% cite post_react_patterns --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
{% cite post_five_ways_to_advanced_react_patterns --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
{% cite post_react_component_patterns --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
{% cite post_advanced_patterns_reactjs --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
{% cite post_introduction_to_react_design_patterns --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}, or
as {% cite post_how_to_master_advanced_react_design_patterns --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %} states,
instead of rendering the children (which is as common technique in reactjs), this pattern
renders the prop. Eventhough {% cite post_how_to_master_advanced_react_design_patterns --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %} states that the render prop renders the prop, instead of the children, {% cite post_how_advanced_react_patterns_changed_with_hooks --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %},{% cite post_5_react_data_fetching --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %} and {% cite  post_common_i18n_patterns_in_react --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %} describes the render prop
using the children explicitly.

Furthermore {% cite post_evolving_patterns_in_react --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}
states that the pattern render props and HoC are interchangeable.

The term render callback is clearer in the intention
of the pattern, but the term, render props got more adoption from the
community {% cite post_react_patterns_render_callback --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %}.

On the other hand {% cite post_simple_react_patterns --file 2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search %},
states that there are discution between the effectiveness of the pattern.

## Conclusion

ReactJs is among the most used UI libraries, as a result it has a lot of
content created by the community and by Facebook (which is the company behind
rectJS). The proposed study showed the most used reactjs patterns as well as
the themes that surround the patterns. As it tuns out, the most popular patterns
are components and props, which are the reactjs foundation and not advanced
patterns for experienced reactjs developers. On the other hand, patterns
like Higher order components, hooks and container component requires some previous
knowledge to be used effectively, but those patterns that require
more experience are the ones less popular as well.
