It's been one week since I adopted vim as my main editor, and this is the second post about this journey.
If you haven't read the [first](/thoughts/2018/01/21/30-days-of-vim.html) post yet, click here and be happy.

## First impressions

I feel like I have the control over my editor and the navigation is REALLY fast with the `w` and `e` letters.
The key challenge here (I believe, and I haven't achieved yet) is to move the navigation from the key
arrows (up, down, left and right) to `k`, `j`, `h` and `l`. As it seems to be weird at first the book
[Practical Vim](https://pragprog.com/book/dnvim2/practical-vim-second-edition) from Drew Neil in it's
chapter 8 says that using those keys improves the productivity as your hand won't leave the home row.

Besides Drew's book, vimtutor, [vim adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/) and
[A byte of vim](https://vim.swaroopch.com/) encorages the same approach.

As I can't use the home row to navigate yet, to search a string in a file, I would say, is one of the
best things to use in vim (which I've been using a lot). VScode uses the combination of `CMD + F`
on MAC, while Vim uses the `/` followed by the desired string.
