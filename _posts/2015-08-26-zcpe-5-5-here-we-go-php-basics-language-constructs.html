<p>Zend divided language constructs in three main categories <strong>output construct</strong>, <strong>evaluation construct</strong> and <strong>others constructs</strong>, you can find this division in zend <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/services/certification/php-certification-study-guide" target="_blank">study guide for PHP 5.5 exam</a>.</p>

<h1>What is the difference ?</h1>
<p>You can argue that those language constructs are just regular functions and they haven't anything in special, but actually they have. In PHP language constructs can be used with or without parentheses, so let's illustrate:</p>

{% highlight php %}
<?php
require 'foo/bar.php';   //valid
require ('foo/bar.php'); //valid
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Both are correct to use, but it is recommended to do not use with parentheses for the sake of good practice. Therefore we aren't allowed to use any function provided by PHP without parentheses:</p>

{% highlight php %}
<?php
$a = [];
$b = [];

array_merge($a, $b); //valid
array_merge $a, $b;  //invalid
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Some posts in the internet said language constructs are faster than built-in functions, but we must remember that it is a matter of microseconds and I think it is worthless to bother about it.</p>
