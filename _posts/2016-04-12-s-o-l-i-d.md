<p>Being able to write better is a achievement that every programmer want to. SOLID is a great thing to start to
    and particularly one of the best things to be followed by TDD.</p>

<section class="post-section">
<h1 class="post-title">Single responsibility</h1>
<blockquote><p>a class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. only one potential change in the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class)</p></blockquote>

<?php
class Upload {

    private $file;

    public function __construct($file)
    {
        $this->file = $file;
    }

    public function validate($data)
    {
        // apply validation rules
    }
       
    public function moveFile()
    {
        // move file
    }

    public function rename()
    {
        // rename file
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>We have our class Upload doing too many things at once</p>
<ul>
<li>Validates the file</li>
<li>Move the file</li>
<li>Renaming the file</li>
<li>Lack of file object</li>
</ul>
<p>A better approach to it is to create a new class to validate it, to move it and finally to handle it to a new place, let's see some code</p>
{% highlight php %}
<?php
class File {}

class ValidateFile {}

class MoveFile {}

class TransformFile {}


class Upload {

    private $file;

    public function __construct(File $file)
    {
        $this->file = $file;
    }

    public function validate($data)
    {
        // apply validation rules
    }
       
    public function moveFile()
    {
        // move file
    }

    public function rename()
    {
        // rename file
    }

<h1 class="post-title">Open/Close</h1>
<blockquote><p>software entities … should be open for extension, but closed for modification.</p></blockquote>


<p>This principle is followed by many vendors to allow developers extend features without change the original source code. Lets first understand the problem
we want to solve. lets imagine we have a class to send data through a webservice and at the time we have only the XML handler to send this but you client requested you to
implement the feature to support JSON, what would you do ?</p>

{% highlight php %}
<?php
class Webservice {

    public function sendXml($data) {
        // handle the send here
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>In the code above we have unfortunately only one choice, add a method <strong>sendJson</strong>, but that would not follow the Open/Close principle. With this action we
would had to change the original source code to add a new feature (should be open for extension, but <strong>closed for modification</strong>). How can we fix this code ?</p>

{% highlight php %}
<?php
abstract class Type {}

class XML extends Type {}

class XML extends Json {}

class Webservice {

    public function send(Type $data) {
        // handle the send here
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

To easily refactor this code accordinly with open/close principle we would first to create a new generic class called <strong>Type</strong>, this class will abstract
the XMl and JSON type, which we can then give to the send date as a parameter.

{% highlight php %}
<?php

$type = new Json();

$webservice = new Webservice();
$webservice->send($json);

{% endhighlight %}

This approach is much cleaner and easier to create a new extension to it, we can extend the <strong>Type</strong> class and create as many types as we want.

<section class="post-section">

<h1 class="post-title">Liskov Substitution</h1>

<blockquote><p>Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program</p></blockquote>

<p>This principle is connected with inheritance one of the most features used in the Object Oriented Programming. The principle says
that the subtype should not alter the result of the program.</p>

<p>In the following example we have a class called <strong>Door</strong>, inside what we have is a simple method
that tell us when the door is open or not.</p>

{% highlight php %}
<?php

class Door {

    protected $open = true;

    public function isOpen()
    {
        return $open;
    }

    public function open()
    {
        $this->open = true;
    }

    public function close()
    {
        $this->open = false;
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>
    A simply class and easy to use, then we have our client code, who uses that class
</p>

{% highlight php %}
<?php

class Client {

    public function execute(Door $door)
    {
        if ($door->isOpen()) {
            $door->close();
        }
    }
}

$client = new Client();
$client->execute(new Door());

{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now let' say we have other door but this time this door is a decorated one.</p>

{% highlight php %}
<?php

class DecoratedDoor extends Door {

    public function isOpen()
    {
        if (!parent::isOpen()) {
            throw new \Exception('Door is closed');
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The code above is valid but if the client decided to use the <strong>DecoratedDoor</strong> his code will break. We are not following
the Liskov principle "Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program".</p>

{% highlight php %}
<?php

// Original code
$client = new Client();
$client->execute(new Door());

/**
 * The client can' use the DecoratedDoor because it throws an Exception
 */
$client = new Client();
$client->execute(new DecoratedDoor());
{% endhighlight %}

<p>In other words to fix this problem and follow the Liskov principle we need just provide for the client class
the same result that he expects from the <strong>Door</strong> class, true or false.</p>
</section>

<section class="post-section">
<h1 class="post-title">Interface Segregation</h1>
<blockquote>
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
</blockquote>

<p>This I think is the easier one to understand, the quote above is really clear. So let' dive into the source code
and get our hands dirty.</p>

{% highlight php %}
<?php
interface Bird {

    public function fly();

    public function eat();
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>The interface above has two methods to our Bird, and we can implement this interface really easy and well, as the code below shows</p>

{% highlight php %}
<?php
class ConcreteBird implements Bird {

    public function fly()
    {
        print 'I can fly';
    }

    public function eat()
    {
        print 'I can eat';
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>This kind of generalization works fine and there is just one problem with it, what if I have a bird who doesn't fly or doesn't eat ?
We do not have many options though, we have to implement all methods, therefore what we can do to identify when a bird can't fly or eat is thrown an exception.</p>

{% highlight php %}
<?php
class ConcreteBirdWithoutFly implements Bird {

    public function fly()
    {
        throw new \Exception('I cannot fly');
    }

    public function eat()
    {
        print 'I can eat';
    }
}

class ConcreteBirdWithoutEat implements Bird {

    public function fly()
    {
        print 'I can fly';
    }

    public function eat()
    {
        throw new \Exception('I cannot eat');
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>For many of us its just ok to do this, but the true is that we are implementing a method that we don't need.</p>
<p>Then comes Interface Segregation to save us, "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.". To deal with that we simply create  a new
interface with the method eat.</p>

{% highlight php %}
<?php
interface Bird {

    public function fly();
}

interface Eatable {

    public function eat();
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>With this approach we can finally implements the specific interface instead of jus throw exceptions if the class doesn't support the contract. The following code supports both
<strong>Bird</strong> and <strong>Eatable</strong></p>

{% highlight php %}
<?php

class ConcreteBirdWithoutEat implements Bird, Eatable {

    public function fly()
    {
        print 'I can fly';
    }

    public function eat()
    {
        print 'I can eat';
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This code is more flexible as well, we just implement what we are going to need.
</section>

<section class="post-section">
<h1 class="post-title">Dependency inversion</h1>
<blockquote><p>One should “Depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions</p></blockquote>

<p>The following code just clarify the idea of abstraction and how to depend on it instead of a concrete instance.</p>

{% highlight php %}
<?php

abstract class Drivable {}

class Driver extends Drivable {}

class Car {

    public function run(Drivable $driver) {}
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The following approach allow us to implement as many drivers as we want and give it as a parameter to the run method. </p>
<p>You can complain that we could easy depend directly on <strong>Driver</strong>, but if we do that we will block the flexibility of the code.</p>
